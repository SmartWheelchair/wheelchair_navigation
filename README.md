# The Navigation Team

## Our Mission
  
  Our goal is to build a processor-efficient program to allow for autonomous navigation throughout a user's house. We use Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to map and navigate through a room using only a RGB-D Camera. We aim to keep it easy to install and able to run on an inexpensive Single-Board Computer. Implementing autonomous navigation allows the users to easily navigate to various preset locations within their house while avoiding any obstacles.
  
## Implementation
  
  We are currently using the UDOO x86 Advanced Plus Single-Board Computer

  We are using the ASUS Xtion Pro Live for our RGB-D Camera
